This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Setup Instruction

to run locally

HTE_backend

1. Run npm install to install dependencies.
2. Run npm run dev to start the backend server in development mode.

HTE_FRONTEND

1. Run npm install to install dependencies.
2. Run npm run dev to start the frontend development server.

## Tech Stack Used

1. Frontend: NextJs
2. Backend: NodeJs
3. Database: PostgreSQL (neondb)
4. Search: n/a

# Thought process and design decisions

1. Backend is much easy than frontend
2. Use of Next.js for the frontend, a monorepo structure would be ideal to better manage shared code and streamline development

# Any known issues or limitations

1. Not fully utilize Next Framework, rushing, not thinking much
2. 7 days more than enough to build something more but since got this assessment during UAT week, only start couple days ago

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
